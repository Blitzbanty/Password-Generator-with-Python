# Password Generator

Create secure passwords that are impossible to crack.

This Python code creates a simple GUI application using Tkinter for generating random passwords. It takes user input for the desired password length, then generates a password containing lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated password is displayed in a message box, and also copied to the clipboard. The password generation logic involves randomly selecting characters from predefined lists and concatenating them into a string.
